                    It is the age of knowledge. Nations are conquered through education and technology. Education accompanied with the light of the religion of Islam enlightens the darkness of the world.
                    My message to my Students and all others related to the Central Science Degree College is to let us see that what should we do in future and not to see what we did in the past, because planning for future promotes the individual as well as the nation, while looking back to the past, if it is bad, disappoints the people.
                    I shall say to the students, let us seek Knowledge with keen interest and provide the Muslim Ummah a true, sincere, loyal educated and dedicated leadership, which could draw the Ummah from the difficulties and give its true status that is....................... <br> <br>
